Terly is an extension for Google Chrome capable of recognizing Russian handwritten text.

A year ago, when all schools were transferred to distance learning, teachers had to check many homework assignments sent by students in the form of photographs. I had to gaze for hours at a computer monitor, at the terrible handwriting of students. This put the teachers in great danger, causing fatigue and headaches. The hardest part was for teachers teaching humanitarian subjects, even the number of photographs from each student exceeded 3 pieces. Of course, nothing prevents students from submitting their homework as a file with text typed on a computer. But most of the teachers were against it, referring to the well-known proverb: "What is written with a pen cannot be cut out with an ax."
There is no guarantee that there will be no need for a distance learning format again. Expansion of teachers' time has decreased.
